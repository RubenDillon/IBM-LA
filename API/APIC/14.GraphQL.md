API Connect for GraphQL

IBM API Connect and API Connect Essentials (StepZen)

StepZen is the solution where GraphQL comes, and now is API Connect Essentials. API Connect Essentials provides an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs. API Connect Essentials takes a declarative programming approach (describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying HOW), which results in smaller and more intuitive code, better runtime performance, and faster time to value. StepZen was also designed to be highly flexible. It is compatible with other API approaches and is available as-a-Service (SaaS) while also supporting deployments in private clouds and on-premises data centers.
