Instana on Premises deployment
=


In this document we will discuss how to deploy Instana on Premises. We will be using one of the deployment models and the easiest way to do that.

For this activity we will need a virtual machine with the following reqs (Demo Installation type)
- 16 vCPU
- 64 GB RAM
- six four large filesystems to store data or one large filesystem (2TB) for demo environments
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics at least 500GB 
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/data at least 500GB
     - /mnt/instana//stanctl/metrics at least 500GB
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects at least 500GB
     - /var at least 60 GB
     - /home at least 40 GB
- Linux Operating System (we will be using RHEL 9.2)

Prepare the environment
-

1. Create the different filesystems required for the deployment. Our environment have only one large volume

```
df -h

lsblk

sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdd

sudo mkdir /mnt/tempmnt

sudo mount /dev/vdd /mnt/tempmnt

sudo rsync -avx /mnt/ /mnt/tempmnt/

sudo mv /mnt /mnt.backup
sudo mkdir /mnt

sudo mount /dev/vdd /mnt

ls /mnt

sudo blkid /dev/vdd
# (copy the UUID)

sudo nano /etc/fstab
# Add at the end:
# UUID=UUID-HERE   /mnt   xfs   defaults   0 0

sudo umount /mnt
sudo mount -a
df -h

sudo rm -rf /mnt.backup

```

   
3. Configure the VM to install git and wget

```
sudo dnf install -y git wget
```

4. Configure the /etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1      localhost localhost.localdomain
::1            localhost localhost.localdomain
local-ip         instana instana.training   agent-acceptor.instana.training otlp-http.instana.example.com otlp-grpc.instana.example.com test-marketing.instana.example.com

```


Instana pre reqs 
-

1. Create the required directories

```
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/metrics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/data
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects
```

2. Review that the firewall is disabled

```
systemctl status firewalld
```

If the firewall is disabled, you see an error message that says No such file or directory.

3. Configure the following kernell parameteres

```
sh -c 'echo vm.swappiness=0 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf' && sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
sh -c 'echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf' && sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
grubby --args="transparent_hugepage=never" --update-kernel ALL
```

4. Reboot the virtual machine

```
systemctl reboot
```

6. Verify that the THP is disabled.

```
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

you need to receive something like the following " always madvise [never] "

6. We need to modify the PATH

```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo $PATH
```

7. Tenant and Unit names... we will be using test as unit name and marketing as tenant name


Instana deployment
=

1. Configure environment variables

```
export DOWNLOAD_KEY=<download_key>
```

2. Add the Instana registry

```
cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/Instana-Product.repo
[instana-product]
name=Instana-Product
baseurl=https://_:$DOWNLOAD_KEY@artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/rel-rpm-public-virtual/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=https://_:$DOWNLOAD_KEY@artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/api/security/keypair/public/repositories/rel-rpm-public-virtual
repo_gpgcheck=1
EOF
```

In the following command, replace <download_key> with the download key that you got with your license. For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_1.0.299/src/pages/self_hosted/stanctl/overview.html 

The download key is used for downloading Instana artifacts.
The sales key is used for verifying that you are entitled to use Instana self-hosted.

----
NOTE: The DOWNLOAD KEY (and the SALES KEY) IBMers and IBM Business Partners can get license keys from the Partner Access to Instana presentation. https://ibm.github.io/waiops-tech-jam/labs/instana/opentelemetry/lab-environment/#:~:text=Partner%20Access%20to%20Instana

3. Update the Virtual machine and install stanctl

```
yum clean expire-cache -y
yum update -y
yum install -y stanctl
yum install python3-dnf-plugin-versionlock
yum versionlock add stanctl
stanctl --version

```

4. Deploy the single-node cluster of Instana

```
stanctl up
```
Enter the parameter values at the prompt. 

```
? Choose installation type: demo
? Enter the download key or an official agent key: **********************
? Enter the sales key: **********************
? Enter the domain under which Instana will be reachable: instana.training
? Enter your tenant name: labs
? Enter your unit name: student
? Enter Instana admin password: *****
? Confirm Instana admin password: *****
? Enter TLS certificate file (hit ENTER to auto-generate):
```

It might take several minutes for the Instana backend to be ready.

When you see the following message, your cluster is ready

```

Accessing the Standard Edition UI
=
Use the following URL and access credentials to access the UI:

The default username is admin@instana.local.

The password for the default username is the one that you set during installation.
