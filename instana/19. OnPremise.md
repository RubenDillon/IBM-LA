Instana on Premises deployment
=


In this document we will discuss how to deploy Instana on Premises. We will be using one of the deployment models and the easiest way to do that.

For this activity we will need a virtual machine with the following reqs (Demo Installation type)
- 16 vCPU
- 64 GB RAM
- six four large filesystems to store data or one large filesystem (2TB) for demo environments
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics at least 500GB 
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/data at least 500GB
     - /mnt/instana//stanctl/metrics at least 500GB
     - /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects at least 500GB
     - /var at least 60 GB
     - /home at least 40 GB
- Linux Operating System (we will be using RHEL 9.2)

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/1.0.299?topic=cluster-system-requirements



Prepare the environment
-

1. Create the different filesystems required for the deployment. Our environment have only one large volume

```
df -h

lsblk

sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdd

sudo mkdir /mnt/tempmnt

sudo mount /dev/vdd /mnt/tempmnt

sudo rsync -avx /mnt/ /mnt/tempmnt/

sudo mv /mnt /mnt.backup
sudo mkdir /mnt

sudo mount /dev/vdd /mnt

ls /mnt

sudo blkid /dev/vdd
# (copy the UUID)

sudo nano /etc/fstab
# Add at the end:
# UUID=UUID-HERE   /mnt   xfs   defaults   0 0

sudo umount /mnt
sudo mount -a
df -h

sudo rm -rf /mnt.backup

```

   
3. Configure the VM to install git and wget

```
sudo dnf install -y git wget
```

4. Configure the /etc/hosts  

   In the following example
   - training is our local domain
   - local-ip needs to be changed for your current ip (for example 10.0.0.10)
   - instana is the host name
   - fqdn for this server instana.training
   - INSTANA tenant name: labs  (this is defined when we ask for a on premise subscription for Instana)
   - INSTANA unit name: student (this is defined when we ask for a on premise subscription for Instana)

```
127.0.0.1      localhost localhost.localdomain
::1            localhost localhost.localdomain
local-ip         instana instana.training   agent-acceptor.instana.training otlp-http.instana.training otlp-grpc.instana.training 

```


Instana pre reqs 
-

1. Create the required directories

```
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/metrics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/data
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects
```

2. Review that the firewall is disabled

```
systemctl status firewalld
```

If the firewall is disabled, you see an error message that says No such file or directory.

3. Configure the following kernell parameteres

```
sh -c 'echo vm.swappiness=0 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf' && sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
sh -c 'echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf' && sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
grubby --args="transparent_hugepage=never" --update-kernel ALL
```

4. Reboot the virtual machine

```
systemctl reboot
```

6. Verify that the THP is disabled.

```
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

you need to receive something like the following " always madvise [never] "

6. We need to modify the PATH

```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo $PATH
```


Instana deployment
=

1. Configure environment variables

```
export DOWNLOAD_KEY=<download_key>
```

2. Add the Instana registry

```
cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/Instana-Product.repo
[instana-product]
name=Instana-Product
baseurl=https://_:$DOWNLOAD_KEY@artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/rel-rpm-public-virtual/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=https://_:$DOWNLOAD_KEY@artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/api/security/keypair/public/repositories/rel-rpm-public-virtual
repo_gpgcheck=1
EOF
```

In the command, the download key will be replaced for the export. Please add your download key in <download_key> . For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_1.0.299/src/pages/self_hosted/stanctl/overview.html 

The download key is used for downloading Instana artifacts.
The sales key is used for verifying that you are entitled to use Instana self-hosted.

----
NOTE: The DOWNLOAD KEY (and the SALES KEY) IBMers and IBM Business Partners can get license keys from the Partner Access to Instana presentation. https://ibm.github.io/waiops-tech-jam/labs/instana/opentelemetry/lab-environment/#:~:text=Partner%20Access%20to%20Instana

3. Update the Virtual machine and install stanctl

```
yum clean expire-cache -y

yum update -y
yum install -y stanctl

stanctl --version

```

4. Deploy the single-node cluster of Instana

```
stanctl up
```

The command stanctl could be used with the following attributes
- you could change the default timeout (30m) using ... --timeout 60m0s
- you could add the user from who we will send email using ... --core-smt-from admin@instana.local
- you could add the hostname or IP address of the SMTP server that Instana uses to send email using ... --core-smtp-host instana.training
- you could define which port is used for the SMTP server using... --core-smtp-port 25 


Enter the parameter values at the prompt. 

NOTE: if some parameters are missing (for example the memory configuration and things like that) you could be prompted as follow

in this case, press Y to create the script and run the stanctl-preflight.sh

```
? Choose installation type: demo
? Enter the download key or an official agent key: **********************
? Enter the sales key: **********************
? Enter the domain under which Instana will be reachable: instana.training
? Enter your tenant name: labs
? Enter your unit name: student
? Enter Instana admin password: *****
? Confirm Instana admin password: *****
? Enter TLS certificate file (hit ENTER to auto-generate):
```

Then you will be asked for a version that you whish deploy. At the moment Im writing this, the following versions are available
- 3.305.488-0
- 3.303.503-0
- 3.301.441-0
- 3.299.535-0

We suggest to use the latest version, in this case 3.305...

It might take several minutes for the Instana backend to be ready. In typical situation we need to wait 15 to 30 minutes...

The following will be a "typical" deployment in a really perfomant environment, and the times that we need to wait...

This will be in a typical environment, not with the great performance...

When you see the following message, your cluster is ready

```

Use the following URL and access credentials to access the UI:

The default username is admin@instana.local.

The password for the default username is the one that you set during installation.
