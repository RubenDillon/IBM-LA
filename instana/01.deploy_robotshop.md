# Robotshop deployment in a Linux virtual machine

In this tutorial we will be configuring an application using docker in a linux virtual machine

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 8)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant

Configure the virtual machine 
=

1. Connect the virtual machine using ssh. In our example we have a SSH KEY

       chmod 400 pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem
       ssh -i pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem 169.55.98.38 -p 2223 -l itzuser

2. If you need to register your virtual machine

          sudo rhc connect --username user --password cccccc

3. (Optional). If you want to change the name of the host, you could rename it with the following command

       hostnamectl set-hostname new-client-name.example.com

To review the name of the current FQDN

       hostname -A      
   
4. Install the yum-utils package (which provides the yum-config-manager utility) and set up the repository

        sudo su
        yum install -y yum-utils
        yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo -y

   
5. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:

        sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
   
6. Initiate docker

          sudo systemctl enable docker.service
          sudo systemctl enable containerd.service

          sudo systemctl status docker
    
          sudo systemctl start docker

8. test docker

       sudo docker run hello-world

9. Deploy git in the virtual machine

       sudo yum install git -y

10. Clone the repository to the virtual machine

              git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git

Deploy the Robot Shop application
=

1. Pull or build the application. If you want to build, continue with the following step. If you want to pull ... use the following command and continue in step 3

       cd robot-shop
       sudo docker compose pull

3. Run the application

       export INSTANA_AGENT_KEY="xxxx"

       sudo docker compose up -d
   
4. You could use the recommendation to access the application (read below) or use the load generator

5. To use a load generator

          cd load-gen
          ./load-gen.sh -d


Deploy the Instana Agent in the virtual machine
=

1. Then open Instana, go to Settings -> Agents. Then select Install Agents button and finally select the Linux Automatic Installation (One liner)

2. From Step 1 use the defaults (Dynamic, Azul Zulu 1.8 and Interactive) and in the Step 2 select "Install and start as service". Copy the line and execute in the virtual machine
    
3. You could check the status of the agent in the virtual machine and using the Instana UI

       sudo systemctl status instana-agent.service
       
4. Using the Instana UI, you could go to Settings -> Agents and review the Agent Details (you could see the icon with the magnifying glass to select your virtual machine)


Change the behaviour of the application
=

1. If you want to add more load to the application and introduce an error in Payment you could modify the load-gen.sh file from the folder loadgen. You need to do the following changes, at least

       - NUM_CLIENTS=100                                    ---- this is line 7
       - RUNTIME=1h                                         ---- this is line 10
       - ERROR=1                                            ---- this is line 16
       - name loadgen2                                      ---- this is line 97
   
2. Then you could run the loader using the following command

     sudo ./load-gen.sh 


Create a Zone for the Virtual Machine
=

1. If you want to put your virtual machine in a particular zone, we could edit the file configuration.yaml in /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana and modify the file to have something like the following

       # Hardware & Zone
       com.instana.plugin.generic.hardware:
         enabled: true # disabled by default
         availability-zone: 'Demo'

 2. Saving the file, we need to wait a couple of minutes and the Infrastructure dashboard will show the VM in a zone called DEMO


Access the application
=

1. To access the application, we need to disable the firewall or to enable the access to port 8080. For testing, we will disable the firewall of the VM

   systemctl disable firewalld

2. Then using a browser use the public IP of the VM and the port 8080

   http://x.x.x.x:8080


Troubleshooting Robot-Shop App
=

If the application dont show connections between the components, restart docker service and start again the application

       systemctl stop docker
       systemctl stop docker.service
       systemctl start docker
       docker compose up -d

in another terminal

       cd load-gen
       ./load-gen.sh -d  

       (-d parameter if you want to run in silent mode the load generator)


If you want remove everything (images, docker, etc...)

       docker rmi -f $(docker images -q) 

       docker volume ls

       docker volume prune

       docker container list

       docker image ls

To search which ports are open
=

Run the following command

       nc -v -n 52.118.185.130 1-8100

where 52.118.185.130 is the IP address that we want to search, 1-8100 the ports that want to figure out if they are opened.

Another way is using nmap

       nmap 52.118.185.130


A simple way to add load
=

Copy the following script and run it

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698bc2d9-3c81-42d1-8322-b5b928f98a2a)


       

(Optional) - Deploy Quote of the day application
=
This is a very simple application to test it

git clone https://gitlab.com/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day.git

Download start.sh and load.sh from https://gitlab.com/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day/-/blob/master/docker_deployment.md

Then follow the next steps

       chmod +x start.sh 
       chmod +x load.sh

Then to start the application, you need to run using the script with the local IP Address (not public for example)

       ./start.sh 10.240.1.171

If you have any port open, typically the application will run in http://dockerIP:3000 

If you have some port restrictions, you need to modify the file start.sh with the ports that you need (for example 8080)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac7db63-371c-4dcd-86ba-bc8b705c40cf)

       



(Optional) - Deploy Mealie 
=
This is a Self Hosted Recipe Manager

https://hub.docker.com/r/hkotel/mealie

Follow the next steps

       git clone https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie.git  or clone from https://github.com/RubenDillon/mealie

       cd mealie

       change the port to 8080 if you want to use another port than the default  ( use the example from github/RubenDillon/IBM/instana/AppB.docker-compose.yml )

       docker compose build --no-cache

       docker compose up -d

       http://dockerIP:8080
       
If you want to import recipes ... you could try for example.. the following recipes

       - https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/269004/one-pot-spaghetti-with-meat-sauce/
       - https://cookpad.com/ar/recetas/22549658-paleta-a-la-cacerola?ref=inspiration_feed

You need to modify and add code to the Python environment to be discovered and used by INSTANA


       docker container list   (you will discover where MEALIE is running and which command invoques the app... in this case /app/run.sh)
       docker exec -it xxxy bash
       apt-get update
       apt-get install vim
       pip install instana
       apt update
       apt install curl

Review the interfaces that are created in the virtual machine using Instana
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d04fad-ccbc-492d-88a3-3c45023adb12)

Try each one to understand who have connectivity with the host (for example with our environment)
       
       curl 127.0.0.1:42699
       curl 10.240.1.172:42699
       curl 172.18.0.1:42699
       curl 172.17.0.1:42699

up to receive a message like {"version":"2025.05.06.1431"} that indicates that the container could access the Instana agent running in the host

Now we need to give this information to python environment
       
       cd app
       vi run.sh

Add the following lines
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7179aca2-73dd-4c19-a7da-afdac284b7fe)


edit app.py 

       find / -name app.py
       vi app.py

add the following line (close to other import in the file at the beginning)
       
       import instana 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d90130-3f23-4155-9239-41cb0d1f4175)


exit from the container and then restart it

       docker container restart xxxy

Then you need to update the instana agent deployment

       docker exec -it xxxy bash

       pip install gitpython
       pip install -U instana

exit from the container and then restart it

       docker container restart xxxy

Then need to restart the Instana agent associated to this virtual machine

Now.. you will see the python application and you could start to receive information from the application

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60855e5-72ca-4b90-9048-1f7ca4d24e21)



(Optional) - Deploy Budget Zero 
=
Budgetzero is a free, open-source, privacy-friendly, offline-first budgeting system. 

https://hub.docker.com/r/budgetzero/budgetzero


Basically...

       docker pull budgetzero/budgetzero:latest
       docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name budgetzero budgetzero/budgetzero

Then you need to modify the Nginx configuration

       docker exec -it xxxx /bin/sh

       cd /etc/nginx/conf.d

       vi default.conf

add the following at the beginning

       location /nginx_status {
         stub_status  on;
         access_log   off;
         allow all; # Or the Remote IP of the Instana Host Agent

       }


then restart the container xxxx 

       docker container restart xxxx



(Optional) - Deploy FireFly III 
=
"Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. It can import data from external sources and it has many neat financial reports available.

https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core

Follow the next steps

       Create three files that are mentioned in https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/installation/docker/

       Basically you need to download 
              docker-compose.yml
              .env
              .db.env

       for example using 
       
              curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/main/.env.example > env.example 

       then rename the file

              cp env.example .env

       Then you need to run the following command

              docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --pull=always

       Then you could access the application using http://dockerIP

       
If you want more information about the MariaDB, you need to add the following in the configuration.yml from /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c69eb6-4704-43f2-9fe3-238d9ef84b17)


(Optional) - Develop and Deploy Hello World in Springboot  
=
       Follow the step by step described in the following link

https://www.atlantic.net/dedicated-server-hosting/how-to-deploy-spring-boot-application-on-ubuntu-22-04/


A Spring Boot application is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot is an open-source framework designed to simplify the process of creating production-grade, stand-alone Spring-based applications. It provides various features and conventions that streamline configuration, dependency management, and application deployment.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to deploy spring boot application on Ubuntu 22.04.

Step 1 – Install Java JDK
Spring Boot requires Java to be installed on your server. You can install it using the following command:

       apt install openjdk-18-jdk-headless -y

After the successful installation, verify the Java version using the following command:

       java -version

Step 2 – Install Spring Boot CLI
Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by the Spring Boot framework for quickly developing and testing Spring Boot applications without needing to set up a full-fledged project structure. It allows developers to write, run, and test Spring Boot applications with minimal configuration.

There are multiple ways to install Spring Boot CLI. In this section, we will install Spring Boot CLI using SDKMAN.

First, install the Zip and Unzip utility.

       apt install unzip zip

Next, install SDKMAN using the following command:

       curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash

Please open a new terminal, or run the following in the existing one:

    source "/root/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

Then issue the following command:

    sdk help

Next, source the new SDKMAN! shell from the terminal window.

       source "/root/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

Next, install the Spring Boot CLI using SDK.

       sdk install springboot

Step 3 – Create a Spring Boot Application
In this section, we will create a simple “Hello World” Spring Boot application using Maven.

First, install Gradle using the following command.

       sdk install gradle 7.5.1

Next, generate a simple Spring Boot project named “hello” in the “hello-world” directory, with Gradle as the build tool.

       spring init --build=gradle --dependencies=web --name=hello hello-world --type=gradle-project

Next, edit the HelloApplication.java file.

       nano ~/hello-world/src/main/java/com/example/helloworld/HelloApplication.java

Modify is as shown below:

       package com.example.helloworld;

       import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
       import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
       import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
       import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

       @SpringBootApplication
       public class HelloApplication {

           public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(HelloApplication.class, args);
           }

       }

       @RestController
       class Hello {

           @RequestMapping("/")
           String index() {
               return "Hello world";
           }
       }

Save and close the file.

Then, navigate inside your application directory and create a new build with the following command:

       cd hello-world
       ./gradlew build

Step 4 – Run Spring Boot Application
First, run the application without building the jar file to test it quickly.

       gradle bootRun


Step 5 – Create a Systemd File
It is always a good idea to create a systemd file to manage a Spring Boot application. You can create it using the following command:

       nano /etc/systemd/system/helloworld.service

Add the following lines:

       [Unit]
       Description=Spring Boot HelloWorld
       After=syslog.target
       After=network.target

       [Service]
       User=root
       Type=simple

       [Service]
       ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /root/hello-world/build/libs/hello-world-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
       Restart=always
       StandardOutput=syslog
       StandardError=syslog
       SyslogIdentifier=helloworld

       [Install]
       WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save the file, then reload the systemd daemon.

       systemctl daemon-reload 

Now, start the Spring Boot service using the following command.

       systemctl start helloworld

To check your application running status, run:

       systemctl status helloworld

Step 6 – Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy
You will also need to configure Nginx reverse proxy to implement the application as a web service.

First, install the Nginx package.

       apt install nginx -y

Next, create an Nginx virtual host:

       nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/helloworld.conf

Add the following configuration:

       server {
               listen 80;

               server_name helloworld.example.com;

               location / {
                   proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
                   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
               }
       }

Save the file and then edit the Nginx main configuration file:

       nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Add the following line after the line http{:

server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

Save and close the file, then verify Nginx for any syntax errors.

       nginx -t

Finally, restart the Nginx service to apply the changes.

       systemctl restart nginx

Step 7 – Access Spring Boot Application

At this point, your Spring Boot application is created with Nginx as a reverse proxy. You can now access it
