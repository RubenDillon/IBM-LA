Configure a Service Level Objective
=

This step will be used to create a SLO (Service Level Objective) and then create a Smart Alert for that SLO. 

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are important tools for observability that organizations can use to monitor the performance and availability of their services in a systematic and objective way. SLOs enable you to define clear targets for system performance to help in identifying degraded user experience and platform instability. Also, SLOs can be used to track the performance of a service over time to enable organizations to identify trends and patterns in service performance.

Users can set a target for system performance over a time based on the indicator provided. When the target is not reached, further analysis can be completed to determine the cause of the degraded performance.


Go to the Instana UI and select SLO from the left menu. Complete the data with the following
- select the Robotshop Application
- in the Scope, select ALL Calls

Move down and complete the following
- in Service and Endpoint, search for the nginx-web
- in Set Indicator, select Availability and then Type .. time and use Agregation mean and then Error Rate 99%

Move down and complete the following
- in Set Objective, select 99,9% in SLO target
- in Time window, select fixed
- in SLO name, complete something that will have meaning on this SLO

Move down and review the preview (from data of the last 7 days)

Configure a Smart Alert
=

You can create Smart Alerts for Service Level Objectives (SLO) to send an alert when a percentage of the error budget is used up or when the SLO status is less than the configured threshold. To send a Smart Alert, the conditions that are configured must persist over a specified amount of time.

From the SLO view, select Add Smart Alert from the end right corner

Review that the current SLO is selected

Then review Trigger and Threshold elections ... and then Create

In the SLO view, we could review the Smart Alert, selecting "Smart Alert" tab
