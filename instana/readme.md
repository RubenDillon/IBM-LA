IBM Instana Observability automatically discovers, maps, and monitors all services and infrastructure components, providing complete visibility across your application stack. It continuously captures every trace, detects changes in real-time and provides detailed insights to automate root cause detection and resolution. Instanaâ€™s modern approach to observability consists of:

- Built-in automation across every part of the platform, from instrumentation to discovery, mapping and grouping all the way to visualizing data and analytics
- Application and infrastructure context so you can immediately understand how issues with one component are affecting others
- AI-powered intelligent actions that provide timely mitigation recommendations and automatic issue remediation
- Simple, predictable and transparent pricing that is based on the number of hosts (physical or virtual) being monitored 

This page is dedicated to everything that we could use in IBM Instana. 

Is the base of what we use for partner and customer trainning.
