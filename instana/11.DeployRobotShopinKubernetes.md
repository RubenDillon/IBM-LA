Deploying Robot Shop application in Kubernetes (K3s version)
=

1 We will be using K3s to deploy Robot Shop in this example. If you dont have already deployed a K3s, please review the information in the current github.

2 Once you have K3s, Instana Agent and Kubectl command cli deployed, review if you have the github cli deployed. If you donÂ´t have it, continue with the following step

    sudo yum install git

3 Then clone the Robot-Shop git

    git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git


# Changing the default Storageclass in the K3s 

1 Change the default storageclass in K3s

    kubectl get storageclass local-path  -o yaml > storageclass.yaml

2 Edit the file storageclass.yaml and change the name of the storage class to standard


3 Apply the new class and change the default class in the K3s

    kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml

    kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'

    kubectl get storageclass

# Configuring Helm in the Virtual machine (if you dont have it)

1 Deploy HELM if you already dont have it

    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh

2 If you need to add the path /usr/local/bin to PATH, follow the next steps

    echo $PATH
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

3 Test to access helm 

    helm version

# Deploying the Robot-Shop using the helm chart    

1 Move it to the Robot-Shop folder for K8s, move to the helm folder, create the ns robot-shop and then run the helm to deploy it
      
     kubectl create ns robot-shop
     helm install robot-shop --namespace robot-shop .

2 To review where the app is published run the following command

    kubectl get svc -n robot-shop
    
3 You will found a service called "web" that have a External-IP address. Use that with http and port 8080 to access it, as follows

    http://169.62.110.155:8080

4 To give load the solution, open the load-deployment.yaml and change the URL to contact the solution
