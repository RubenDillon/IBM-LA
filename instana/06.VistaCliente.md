# Client view - Website monitoring

Website monitoring, often called End-User Monitoring (EUM), or Real-User Monitoring (RUM), is an important tool to understand digital user experience.

Instana supports website monitoring by analyzing actual browser request times and route loading times. It allows detailed insights into the web browsing experience of users, and deep visibility into application call paths.

The Instana website monitoring solution works by using a lightweight JavaScript agent, which is embedded into the monitored website. To install the JavaScript agent, access the Websites section in the Instana UI to start tracking website performance data. The Instana UI guides you through the installation process.

Create a Website monitoring

1. Go to the Website and Mobile Applications and select Add Website

2. Create a name for the view

3. Copy the javascript tracking script






Website and Mobile apps

1. Connect to the container where the web server is running (find the IMAGE named robotshop/rs-web:2.1.0 )

       docker container list
       docker exec -it 2xc09380q340932809 bash

3. Update the container and deploy vim 

       apt-get update
       apt-get install vim

4. go to folder /usr/share/nginx/html and modify the file index.html using vim 

       vim index.htlm

5. Copy the javascript tracking script that INSTANA created for this website view

          This is what the index.html looks like

          This is what we need to looks like (using the javascript tracking script from INSTANA for the site that Im using)

   <img width="697" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd9e8d9c-b0d0-4ba7-a492-7164331ed190">

6. If you want to add traffic to your Robot-shop, you could open a browser and use any kind of refresh extension for the browser or run for example a script with the following
