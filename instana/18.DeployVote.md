This is an open source application where we have different languages and different engines.
The main idea is one service provides the option to vote (cats or dogs) and the other service provides the results.


Using docker
-

Clone the github source code

    git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app.git

We will modify the Source code to add Instana environment variables
-

Modify the app.py to support instana from the build

    cd vote
    vi app.py

Change the document to include import instana as follows

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b83a1e-99d5-4dd1-aea0-bf581081464f)
   
Then, edit Dockerfile to include environment variables and to run pip install instana

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54ba21e-0d5a-4127-81b6-e9434138309f)


Build the images

    docker compose build --no-cache

Initiate the application

    docker compose up -d
    

Now its time to modify parameters for PostgreSQL
-

Add the user and password of PostgreSQL to the Instana configuration file

        vi /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana/configuration.yaml

Modify the com.instana.plugin.postgresql to have the following information

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e860495-4f0d-43e1-a0e5-c6a8b1863202)

Search for the Postgresql configuration file and make changes to provide statistics

    find / -name postgresql.conf
    vi /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf

The file needs to looks like the following
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0da821-1576-43ba-bd1f-a4c452327d45)

Then, reload the configuration file of PostgreSQL

    find / -name pg_ctl
    su - postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data reload"
