# Use of Actions in Instana

In this tutorial we will be configuring Instana Actions 

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 9)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant
- We already have Robot-Shop deployed

Situation:
We have some strange behaviour in our application. The strange behaviour is simulated when we drop a MySQL docker in the application.
In Instana will we create a Smart Alert that pay attention in Erroneous Calls, will create an Action (restart all the containers) and a Policy associated to the Smart Alert.

We want to Instana detect the problem, create Incident, give us information about the root cause and apply the policy associated to this problem.


Create the Smart Alert from a Robot-SHop Perspective
=

1. Create the Smart Alert using the Wizard for Erroneous Calls

Create the Action and the Policy
=

1. Create the Action from the Automation menu
<img width="1333" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cd14c0-0c6e-4b0b-9416-b815e54f7516" />

<img width="1333" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72f21115-00ab-4ce7-82d6-f247cf988168" />

 2. Create the Policy in the Automation menu
  <img width="1333" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94e637f-8ef9-414f-a8e8-1d2b2dbc65e6" />

Configure the Action in the Instana Sensor
=
 1. Connect to the Virtual Machine where Robot-shop runs and create the Insta user 

         sudo su
         useradd insta
         passwd insta
         usermod -aG wheel insta
         usermod -aG docker insta
         su - insta
         git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git
         exit


 2. Configure Instana configuration file

         cd /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana/
         vi configuration.yaml

```
com.instana.plugin.action.script:
  enabled: true
  runAs: 'insta'
#  runAsUserPassword: # required only for Windows
#    configuration_from:
#      type: vault
#      secret_key:
#        path: <secret_path>
#        key: <secret_key>
  scriptExecutionHome: /home/insta      # optional
```

 Force the error in the application
 =

 1. Connect to the Virtual Machine where Robot-shop runs and execute the following commands

        docker container list

        docker container stop xxxx (where xxxx is the mysql container)

 3. Review the Robot-Shop Perspective and wait to start to have Erroneous Calls

Review the events
=

1. Wait for the correlation of events that occurs with this situation

2. Select the first related with rs-mysql-db and scroll up to "Recommended actions"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99945989-b4e4-484a-814b-c820ad2ab367)

3. Review that we have a Recommended action and have Sucess Rate and High Confidence. Press the Run button and select your VM

4. Rreview that the mysql will restart and everything in a couple of minutes, will return to the normality

A more efficient way to resolve this (a more quick reaction to resolve the problem)
=

1. We could learn of what happen in this situation. We could review the events and try to catch the first event and execute. For that, we review the Issues tab in Events menu when the problem occurs
<img width="1414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c718ade8-c231-4dbb-8ce6-ba7b90a6dd6b" />

2. As we know that the problem is related with mySQL... we select the first event related to and review the information that is recolected. We scroll down until we found Recommended Actions
<img width="1414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52371bd-46b5-4e29-b81f-c8265d2725b9" />

3. We found that the action "Reiniciar contenedor" has a High Confidence and Sucess Rate to use it. With that... we could create a Policy to run it when this event occurs
<img width="1414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f6a2d1-6e70-4687-b637-36782e20edea" />

<img width="1414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/552da2bd-3de9-4d51-b83f-3e10855343eb" />

4.  If we go to Automation, policies.. we will see a new Policy already created
<img width="1414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ad606be-342c-4122-b67a-e76a43224f2e" />

5.  If we change it to Automatic, the response to this problem will be quick
<img width="1567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ced7609d-7433-4ccc-963e-361e4bcaf6bc" />


In our example, we stopped the mysql container at 15:39 and the service was restored at 15:42 automatically. The docker container was restored at 15:40.

A better efficient way
=

A better way to discover the mySQL problem and not any problem, is defining to view only that problem in the Smart alert

If we review the compose file, we review that is a dependency between ratings, shipping, web and mysql. For that reason, we suggest change the script
